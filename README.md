This repository hosts the C++ source code of our algorithms related to the manuscript "Differentially Private frugal Estimation of Quantiles".

We provide algorithms working in:

the central differential privacy model 
- Frugal_1U with Laplace, Gaussian and rho-zCDP mechanisms;
- Frugal-2U with Sample and Aggregate mechanism;

the local differential privacy model 
- Frugal_1U with Randomized Response mechanism;
- Frugal_2U with Square Wave mechanism;
- EasyQuantile with Square Wave mechanism;
- LDPQ.
