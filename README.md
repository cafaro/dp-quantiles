This repository hosts the C++ source code of our algorithms related to the manuscript "Differentially Private frugal Estimation of Quantiles"
by Marco Pulimeno, Massimo Cafaro, Angelo Coluccia and Italo Epicoco.
University of Salento, Lecce, Italy


We provide algorithms working in:

the central differential privacy model 
- Frugal_1U with Laplace, Gaussian and rho-zCDP mechanisms;
- Frugal-2U with Sample and Aggregate mechanism;

the local differential privacy model 
- Frugal_1U with Randomized Response mechanism;
- Frugal_2U with Square Wave mechanism;
- EasyQuantile with Square Wave mechanism;
- LDPQ.
